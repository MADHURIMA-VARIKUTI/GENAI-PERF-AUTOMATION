# GenAI-Perf Automation

### Overview
GenAI-Perf is NVIDIA’s open-source benchmarking command-line tool for measuring the throughput and latency of generative AI models. These metrics are critical for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems.

This project automates the process of deploying and managing Kubernetes resources for GenAI-Perf benchmarking. It includes functionality for creating namespaces, secrets, pods, PVCs, and running benchmark scripts.

### Key Metrics Captured
For large language models (LLMs), GenAI-Perf provides the following metrics:
- **Time to First Token**: The time taken to generate the first token.
- **Time to Second Token**: The time taken to generate the second token after the first.
- **Inter-Token Latency**: The latency between generating consecutive tokens.
- **Output Token Throughput**: The rate at which tokens are generated.
- **Request Throughput**: The number of requests processed per unit time.

These metrics helps to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of generative AI models.

### Features
- Kubernetes namespace management
- Secret creation and management
- Pod creation and monitoring
- PVC configuration and deployment
- Runtime YAML Configurations
- Benchmark execution and artifact collection and logging

3.	image = "10.14.75.21/ezmeral-common/nvcr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-pb24h2:1.3.2",  Developer use only, change as per requirement
4.	selected_model_id = "8af967d80ae8f30f4635a59b2140fdc2b38d3004e16e66c9667fa032e56497fd", it will get overwritten by script


 ##### [final_exec]

________________________________________
 ### Instructions for Users
1.	Do not modify sections marked as "Developer use only" unless you understand the implications.
2.	Ensure all paths and configurations are correct to avoid execution errors.
3.	Verify API Keys:
	Ensure the hugging_face_token, ngc_api_key, and ngc_token are valid.
4.	Provided YAML Files:
	Store the YAML files in the yaml folder only.
5.	Set Namespace:
	Update the namespace field in [constants] to match your Kubernetes setup.


 ### Run the main script:
1.	Python3 main.py
2.	Monitor the logs in log folder for progress and errors with timestamp.
